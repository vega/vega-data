## `barley.json`

The result of a 1930s agricultural experiment in Minnesota, this dataset contains yields for 10 different varieties of barley at six different sites. It was first published by agronomists F.R. Immer, H.K. Hayes, and L. Powers in the 1934 paper "Statistical Determination of Barley Varietal Adaption." R.A. Fisher's popularized its use in the field of statistics when he included it in his book ["The Design of Experiments."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Experiments) Since then it has been used to demonstrate new statistical techniques, including the [trellis charts](http://ml.stat.purdue.edu/stat695t/writings/TrellisDesignControl.pdf) developed by Richard Becker, William Cleveland and others in the 1990s.

## `seattle-weather.csv`

Data from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/records). Daily weather records with metric units. Transformed using `/scripts/weather.py`. We synthesized the categorical "weather" field from multiple fields in the original dataset. This data is intended for instructional purposes.

Learn more in the [documentation](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cdo/documentation/NORMAL_HLY_documentation.pdf). We only included temperature, wind, and pressure and updated the format to be easier to parse.

## `us-employment.csv`

In the mid 2000s the global economy was hit by a crippling recession. One result: Massive job losses across the United States. The downturn in employment, and the slow recovery in hiring that followed, was tracked each month by the [Current Employment Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ces/) program at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

This file contains the monthly employment total in a variety of job categories from January 2006 through December 2015. The numbers are seasonally adjusted and reported in thousands. The data were downloaded on Nov. 11, 2018, and reformatted for use in this library.

Totals are included for the [22 "supersectors"](https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/ce/ce.supersector) tracked by the BLS. The "nonfarm" total is the category typically used by economists and journalists as a stand-in for the country's employment total.

A calculated "nonfarm_change" column has been appended with the month-to-month change in that supersector's employment. It is useful for illustrating how to make bar charts that report both negative and positive values.

## `volcano.json`

Maunga Whau (Mt Eden) is one of about 50 volcanos in the Auckland volcanic field. This data set gives topographic information for Maunga Whau on a 10m by 10m grid.

## `weather.csv`

## `wheat.json`

In an 1822 letter to Parliament, [William Playfair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Playfair), a Scottish engineer who is often credited as the founder of statistical graphics, published [an elegant chart on the price of wheat](http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Vis_2.jpg). It plots 250 years of prices alongside weekly wages and the reigning monarch. He intended to demonstrate that “never at any former period was wheat so cheap, in proportion to mechanical labour, as it is at the present time.”
