The burtin.json dataset is based on graphic designer Will Burtin's 1951 visualization of antibiotic \
effectiveness, originally published in Scope Magazine.

The dataset compares the performance of three antibiotics against 16 different bacteria.

Numerical values in the dataset represent the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each \
antibiotic, measured in units per milliliter, with lower values indicating higher antibiotic \
effectiveness.

The dataset was featured as an example in the Protovis project, a precursor to D3.js.

As noted in the Protovis example, "Recreating this display revealed some minor errors in the original: \
a missing grid line at 0.01 μg/ml, and an exaggeration of some values for penicillin".

The vega-datsets version is largely consistent with the Protovis version of the dataset, with one \
correction (changing 'Brucella antracis' to the correct 'Bacillus anthracis') and the addition of a \
new column, 'Genus', to group related bacterial species together.

The caption of the original 1951 [visualization](https://graphicdesignarchives.org/wp-content/uploads/wmgda_8616c.jpg) 
reads as follows:

> ## Antibacterial ranges of Neomycin, Penicillin and Streptomycin
>
>
> The chart compares the in vitro sensitivities to neomycin of some of the common pathogens (gram+ in \
red and gram- in blue) with their sensitivities to penicillin, and streptomycin.
>
> The effectiveness of the antibiotics is expressed as the highest dilution in μ/ml. which inhibits \
the test organism.
>
> High dilutions are toward the periphery; consequently the length of the colored bar is proportional \
to the effectiveness.
>
> It is apparent that neomycin is especially effective against Staph. albus and aureus, Streph. \
fecalis, A. aerogenes, S. typhosa, E. coli, Ps. aeruginosa, Br. abortus, K. pneumoniae, Pr. \
vulgaris, S. schottmuelleri and M. tuberculosis.
>
> Unfortunately, some strains of proteus, pseudomonas and hemolytic streptococcus are resistant to \
neomycin, although the majority of these are sensitive to neomycin.
>
> It also inhibits actinomycetes, but is inactive against viruses and fungi. Its mode of action is \
not understood.

U.S. census data on [occupations](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/OCC1950#codes_section) by \

"collects, preserves and harmonizes U.S. census microdata" from as early as 1790.

Originally created for a 2006 data visualization project called *sense.us* by IBM Research (Jeff Heer, \
Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Viégas), described [here](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/files/bdata_ch12.pdf). 
The dataset is also referenced in this vega [example](https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/job-voyager/).

Data is based on a tabulation of the [OCC1950](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/OCC1950) \
variable by sex across IPUMS USA samples. The dataset appears to be derived from Version 6.0 (2015) of \
IPUMS USA, according to 2024 correspondence with the IPUMS Project. IPUMS has made improvements to \
occupation coding since version 6, particularly for 19th-century samples, which may result in \
discrepancies between this dataset and current IPUMS data. Details on data revisions are available \
[here](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/revisions).

IPUMS USA confirmed in 2024 correspondence that hosting this dataset on vega-datasets is permissible, \
stating:
>We're excited to hear that this dataset made its way to this repository and is being used by students \
for data visualization. We allow for these types of redistributions of summary data so long as the \
underlying microdata records are not shared.

This dataset contains only summary statistics and does not include any underlying microdata records.

1. This dataset represents summary data. The underlying microdata records are not included.
2. Users attempting to replicate or extend this data should use the [PERWT](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/PERWT#description_section) 
(person weight) variable as an expansion factor when working with IPUMS USA extracts.
3. Due to coding revisions, figures for earlier years (particularly 19th century) may not match current \
IPUMS USA data exactly.

The dataset contains two intentional inaccuracies to maintain compatibility with 
the [Wheat and Wages](https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/wheat-and-wages/) example visualization:
1. the start date for the reign of Elizabeth I is shown as 1565, instead of 1558;
2. the end date for the reign of George IV is shown as 1820, instead of 1830.
These discrepancies align the `monarchs.json` dataset with the start and end dates of the `wheat.json` dataset used i the visualization.
The entry \"W&M\" represents the joint reign of William III and Mary II. While the dataset shows their reign as 1689-1702, 
the official Web site of the British royal family indicates that Mary II's reign ended in 1694, though William III continued to rule until 1702.
The `commonwealth` field is used to flag the period from 1649 to 1660, which includes the Commonwealth of England, the Protectorate, 
and the period leading to the Restoration. While historically more accurate to call this the \"interregnum,\" the field name of `commonwealth` 
from the original dataset is retained for backwards compatibility.
The dataset was revised in Aug. 2024. James II's reign now ends in 1688 (previously 1689).

The unemployment rate represents the number of unemployed persons as a percentage of the labor
force. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) glossary:

Unemployed persons (Current Population Survey) [are] persons aged 16 years and older who had
no employment during the reference week, were available for work, except for temporary
illness, and had made specific efforts to find employment sometime during the 4-week period
ending with the reference week. Persons who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which
they had been laid off need not have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed.

This dataset is derived from the [Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS)](https://www.bls.gov/lau/) program, 
a federal-state cooperative effort overseen by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). 
The LAUS program produces monthly and annual employment, unemployment, and labor force data for census regions and divisions,
states, counties, metropolitan areas, and many cities and towns.

- Visit the [LAUS Data Tools](https://www.bls.gov/lau/data.htm) page for [monthly](https://www.bls.gov/lau/tables.htm#mcounty) 
and [annual](https://www.bls.gov/lau/tables.htm#cntyaa) county data.
2. **BLS Public Data API**:
- The BLS provides an API for developers to access various datasets, including LAUS data.
- To use the API for LAUS data, refer to the [LAUS Series ID Formats](https://www.bls.gov/help/hlpforma.htm#LA) to construct your query.
- API documentation and examples are available on the BLS Developers page.
